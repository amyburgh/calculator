# Calculator

This is a web-based calculator built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses event listeners to capture user input, which is then processed using the [Shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm/) to produce a postfix notation array, also known as [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). This array can be solved using a simple stack without having to backtrack.
