# Calculator

On-screen interactive calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. <br>Works by using event listeners to get an input string that is passed into a [Shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm/) to produce a postfix notation array, also know as [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). This array can be solved using a simple stack without having to backtrack.
